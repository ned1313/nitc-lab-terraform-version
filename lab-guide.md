# Terraform Version Check

## Objectives

- Verify that Terraform is installed in your lab environment
- Confirm the installed version of Terraform

## Getting Started

Welcome to the NITC Lab Platform! This lab is designed to help you get familiar with the lab environment and verify that your tools are working correctly.

Your lab environment comes pre-installed with several cloud infrastructure tools including Terraform, AWS CLI, and Azure CLI.

## Task 1: Check Terraform Version

Open a terminal in the code editor on the right side of the screen and run the following command:

```bash
terraform --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Terraform v1.14.5
on linux_amd64
```

Once you have confirmed that Terraform is installed, click the **Check Answer** button to validate your work.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have verified that Terraform is installed and working in your lab environment. In future labs, you will use Terraform to provision real cloud infrastructure.
